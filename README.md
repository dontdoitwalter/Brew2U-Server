<h3> Running your Server </h3>

1. Clone the repo
2. Open your CLI and navigate to the application's folder
3. Run npm install
4. Run nodemon app.js to run the server locally. Serve will run on Localhost:3000
6. Use Postman to run test locally or to persist data into your database on your deployed server.
7. You need to make sure you use your deployed server's URL with the endpoints to presist data into your deployed database.
